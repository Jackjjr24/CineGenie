FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

The sun shines brightly through the windows of a bustling coffee shop. SARAH (28), a freelance writer, sits at a corner table with her laptop, typing furiously. She looks stressed but determined.

SARAH
(to herself)
Come on, Sarah. You can do this.

A cheerful BARISTA (22) approaches with a steaming cup of coffee.

BARISTA
One large cappuccino with extra foam, just how you like it!

SARAH
(smiling)
You're an angel. Thank you so much.

Sarah takes a sip and her face lights up with joy. The coffee seems to give her renewed energy.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Sarah's phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID - it's her AGENT.

SARAH
(answering)
Please tell me you have good news.

AGENT (V.O.)
(excited)
Sarah! The publisher loved your manuscript! They want to meet with you this afternoon!

Sarah jumps up from her seat, nearly spilling her coffee. Other customers turn to look as she does a little victory dance.

SARAH
(shouting)
YES! YES! YES!

BARISTA
(confused)
Everything okay over there?

SARAH
(grinning widely)
Everything is PERFECT!

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Sarah walks out of the coffee shop with a spring in her step, carrying her laptop bag. She stops and looks up at the sky, feeling grateful and excited about her future.

SARAH
(to the sky)
Thank you for this beautiful day!

She starts walking down the street, humming a happy tune.

FADE OUT.
